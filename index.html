        <h3>Kia ora,</h3>
        <p>
            The Southland Boys' High School museum was built in 2006, and boasts an extensive collection of items that tell the story of SBHS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Countless former pupils have been remembered in their achievements, humour, pranks and camaraderie. Sadly, there are also two Honours Boards commemorating more than 200 past students killed in both World Wars. Invercargill’s story is in there too, as well as that of the changing world which the school’s history has spanned.  
</p>
<p>Our Museum is a teaching, learning and research tool for the present boys and staff - a gift to all. Our archivist strongly feels that you can’t be involved with a school without being aware of its history. In other words, if you don’t know where you’ve been, how can you know where you’re going?
